It is surprisingly cold this year, and the first snow in Puget Sound came in early December. I was telling Emily the winter in Seattle would be depressing - long nights with unstoppable drizzling rains, people staying home all the time, taking vitamin Ds as daily supplements. Huh, annoying.

The coldness is not just about temperature. 6 years in after the economy boost from tech growth, finally it came to the peak and starting cooling off. Layoffs after layoffs across the FANNGs, job security resurfaced as topic among employees. 

For me, I am also worried, and worried to a point, my chronic procrastination syndrome is back. Uncertainty makes me feel powerless, and unwilling to push for things to happen - "Who knows if it makes sense or not when tomorrow comes?"

Work aside, life is more interesting. I started to pick up cooking as hobbies, tried Chinese donuts, dumplings, pancakes, You-mian, steamed baos. I may start a cooking receipe session here as well. 

The past 6 months, with Emily near by, I realize work is not everything - and it should not be. Though the guilty of procrastinating (another modern alias of it, "lying flat") still haunts me, the satisfication of happiness from these little trivia events in life does compensate me very much.

It seems to be a historical cold year, but there are always things to work around and make it warmer.
